# Test of annotation for genes involved in pathways

In order to present the usefulness of GSAn, we used some pathways terms (three from Reactome and four from KEGG) to provide a synthetic annotation with Gene Ontology terms. 

The terms of reactome are:

> Interleukin-7 signaling

> Platelet degranulation

> Neutrophil degranulation

and the terms of Kegg are:

> Cell_cycle

> Pytimidine metabolism

> Apoptosis

> T_cell receptor signaling pathway

The JSON files have to be used in the visualization view tool from GSAn ([https://gsan.labri.fr/visualization](https://gsan.labri.fr/visualization)).

The txt files present the gene set associate to each pathway term.
